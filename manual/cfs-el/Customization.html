<h2 class="chapter">Customization</h2>

   <p>cfs-el uses the Emacs customization facilities for setting preferences.

   <p>So you can use the command <code>M-x customize-group RET cfs RET</code>
to access to the cfs customization group.

   <p>There are different options, but consider that there are reasonable
defaults.

   <p>Please read the CFS man pages (<code>man cattach</code> for example) when
the explanation of an option is not enought.
